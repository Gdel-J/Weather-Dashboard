# Weather-Dashboard


## Description



This is an application that allows users to search for a city to get the current weather and 5 day forecast. Cities that users previously looked up will be saved in their local storage.
These cities previously searched will appear in a list; so the user can have access to those cities again and show the weather just by clicking again. 
The application  uses html for structure, Css for styling and Javascript for functionality, third-Party-APIs by requests specific parameters to a URL.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.
